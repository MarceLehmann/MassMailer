# MassMailer ðŸ“¨

> **Live app:** [MassMailer on GitHub Pages](https://marcelehmann.github.io/MassMailer/)

MassMailer is a lightweight microâ€‘app that lets you send personalised mail merges straight from any CSV file in under a minute. **No installation, no backendÂ â€” everything runs 100â€¯% in your browser.**

## Why MassMailer?

* **Zero setup:** open the URL and start mailing.
* **Privacyâ€‘first:** your data never leaves the browserâ€™s local storage (see *Privacy* below).
* **Make.com & MicrosoftÂ 365 integration:** use the readyâ€‘made blueprint to automate delivery via Outlook or any other connector.

2. Import it into Make.com and connect your MicrosoftÂ 365 (Outlook) account.
3. Copy the webhook URL from Make.com and paste it into the *Settings* pane of MassMailer.

## Privacy

MassMailer is a pure frontâ€‘end application. All templates, CSV files and generated emails are stored **only** in your browserâ€™s local storage and are never transmitted to any server. Clear your cache to remove all traces.
